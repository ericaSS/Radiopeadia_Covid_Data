COVID-19 pneumonia - AGE : 70 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Dry cough and fever.
On arrival to Emergency Room, SpO2 of 89% and lymphopenia.
X-ray : No significant findings reported.
In retrospect, a subtle ground-glass pattern can be seen in both lungs, with peripheral distribution.
2-day : Bilateral ground-glass alveolar consolidation with peripheral distribution.
Case Discussion : Microbiologic test was positive to SARS-CoV-2.
This case shows how fast COVID-19 can progress, with typical radiological findings of patchy, bilateral alveolar consolidations with peripheral distribution and ground-glass density in early stages.
