COVID-19 pneumonia with superadded bacterial infection - AGE : 45 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Shortness of breath.
O2 requirement.
Rule out consolidation/ COVID.
X-ray : Bilateral multifocal peripheral patchy consolidations.
No pleural effusion.
CT : Segmental left pulmonary emboli with likely left basal pulmonary infarct.
Diffuse bilateral infiltrates with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a left basal pleural effusion.
Case Discussion : This is a PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia.
Although pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are less common and are not typical findings in COVID-19 pneumonia.
A coexistent bacterial infection should be considered and interval imaging to ensure resolution of the lymphadenopathy would be required with a followup scan in 6-8 weeks time.
