COVID-19 pneumonia - AGE : 70 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Admitted with choledocholithiasis.
COVID-19 contact.
SARS-CoV-2 negative PCR on admission.
Three days later cough and fever.
CT :  Findings – day 3 : coronary sclerosis, mild aortic sclerosis
no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy
two small areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe just above the fissures and in the upper segment of the left lower lobe
dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts
Impression : 1.
Findings are suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia.2.
Biliary obstruction.
Findings – day-15 : 1.endotracheal tube and right jugular central catheter in place.
2.extensive crazy paving pattern with a central and peripheral distribution.3.extensive pulmonary consolidations more basal and peripheral.4.some mediastinal lymph nodes.5.small bilateral pleural effusions.6.status post biliary stent with some residual bile duct dilatation.
Key findings : two small areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) on day 3;extensive crazy-paving pattern (red arrowhead) and consolidations (blue arrowheads) and bilateral pleural effusions (red measurement) on day 15.
Case Discussion : A second real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of the pharyngeal flora just after the first CT was positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
The patient received ERCP and biliary stent placement because of his biliary obstruction.
Subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on day 12 and 15 were also positive.
This case illustrates a progressive course of COVID-19 pneumonia : two very small areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) initially diffuse involvement of more than 75% of all lobes in both lungs with a typical crazy paving pattern and extensive pulmonary consolidations twelve days after symptom onset.
In the second CT, there are also bilateral pleural effusions and some mediastinal lymphadenopathy present, although this is rather atypical for COVID-19 pneumonia.
