COVID-19 pneumonia - evolution over a week - AGE : 50 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : This middle aged man attended the emergency room for a dysthymic sensation 2-3 times a day, breathing difficulty and dry cough.
In the complementary tests, only lymphopenia and elevated CRP stand out.
Therefore, no coronavirus test was performed because he did not meet epidemiological criteria and the patient was discharged.
X-ray : Day-1 : No significant findings.
Lungs clear.
Day-4 :  Patchy, ill-defined bilateral alveolar consolidations, with a peripheral distribution.
Day-5 clinical deterioration : Radiological worsening, with consolidation in the left upper lobe.
Day-7 : Radiological worsening, with typical findings of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Case Discussion : In this case, we show the evolution of a case of COVID-19 pneumonia over one week, where evolution from normal radiography to ARDS is observed.
