COVID-19 pneumonia (CT abdomen) - AGE : 70 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : One week history of fever, dysuria.
Presents to the ER with abdominal pain and nausea.
No respiratory symptoms.
Fever and elevated CRP.
Hyperlipidemia and hypertension.
CT : Findings in the abdomen consist of gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis, a liver cyst in segment 7 and an unclear focal liver lesion in segment 4A and a lesion in the right adrenal gland.
All findings were present at a CT-colongraphy done several month earlier.
In that study (with and without i.v.
contrast) the adrenal lesion was consistent with a lipid-rich adenoma.
Additional findings : Patchy ground-glass opacities in basal lungs bilaterally.
Case Discussion : The radiologist suggested COVID-19 and subsequent testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus.
There are many case reports of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients presenting with only abdominal symptoms and fever, without symptoms from the respiratory tract.
