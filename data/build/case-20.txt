No pericardial or pleural effusion.
Case Discussion : CT study shows the typical CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by positive laboratory tests.
Covid-19 is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Chest CT is an essential tool of the diagnostic work-up of this respiratory infection.
The most common CT findings are pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), GGO with reticular and interlobular septal thickening, and GGO with consolidation, with predominant distribution in the posterior and peripheral part of the lungs.
This case shows a patient with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and the typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia.
