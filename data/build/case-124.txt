COVID-19 is a novel viral pandemic with increasing incidence and a wide spectrum of disease severity.
Many countries are currently (c. March 2020) experiencing community spread to persons without known infectious contacts.
In Spain, the guidelines to determine who to test for COVID-19 are changing.
This implies the risk that some patients discharged from the hospital at that moment, may develop days later, an ARDS.
