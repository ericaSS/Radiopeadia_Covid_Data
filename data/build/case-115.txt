COVID-19 pneumonia - rapidly progressive - AGE : 60 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Fever and odynophagia.
Trip to Italy 7 days ago.
Low oxygen saturation (SpO2 89%) and lymphopenia were observed.
The patient presented clinical worsening during his stay in the emergency department, and radiological control was performed at 12 hours.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected.
X-ray : On admission : Faint, ill-defined alveolar consolidations in both upper lobes.12 hours later : Radiological worsening with patchy, bilateral alveolar consolidations with panlobar opacities, suggesting ARDS secondary to COVID19.
Three days later : Radiological stability, with slight improvement of the alveolar consolidation in right lower lobe.
The patient still needs supportive care measures.
Case Discussion : SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) can lead to rapidly progressive ARDS as shown in this case.
The prognosis is poor and radiologic findings can go from ill-defined alveolar consolidations to bilateral consolidations with panlobar changes as seen in ARDS.
Radiographic and computed tomography (CT) imaging early in the disease course may be normal; chest CT has been described as more sensitive than chest x-ray for the detection of characteristic bilateral, peripherally-predominant ground-glass opacities.
However, the patient's clinical situation often does not allow a CT scan.
