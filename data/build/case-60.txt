COVID-19 pneumonia - AGE : 85 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Recent onset of dry cough, severe dyspnea, fever and fatigue.
CT : Findings :
Quality : no artefacts;
coronary sclerosis, mild aortic sclerosis;
no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy;
Pulmonary findings:
extensive patchy bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacities (GGO);
predominantly peripheral distribution in the left lung, peripheral and central distribution in the right lung;
partial consolidations along the bronchovasular bundles surrounded by ground-glass opacities (GGO);
superimposed inter-and intralobular septal thickening (crazy-paving pattern) in the right lower lobe;
bilateral vascular dilatation;
Additional findings:
pulmonary nodule (18mm) in the anteromedial segment of the left lower lobe;
no pleural effusions.
Impression:
Findings are compatible with atypical pneumonia.
In view of the patient's symptoms and the current COVID-19 pandemic, this is indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia.
Key findings:
extensive ground-glass opacities (GGO) with bilateral and multi-lobar distribution;
crazy paving pattern (red arrows);
combination of consolidations and surrounding ground-glass opacities also referred to as "Halo sign" (blue arrows);
vascular dilatation (green arrows);
fibrous bands or streaks (yellow arrow);
air bronchogram (orange arrows);
Case Discussion : This case illustrates a spectrum of findings in COVID-19 pneumonia :
extensive ground-glass opacities (GGO);
bilateral and multi-lobar distribution;
crazy-paving pattern;
combination of ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation;
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after pharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
The patient has been put under isolation and referred to the intensive care unit (ICU).
