COVID-19 pneumonia - AGE : 65 years, GENDER : Female
Presentation : Patient with positive swab for COVID-19, was previously discharged from hospital, came back complaining of spiking temperature and shortness of breath.
X-ray : There is a large right-sided pneumothorax associated with collapse of a significant proportion of the right lung which shows evidence of consolidation.
The left lung is clear, the tip of the NG tube is below the level of the left hemidiaphragm.
Case Discussion : COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a strain of coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019).
Despite lower sensitivity when compared to CT, plain chest radiograph is commonly the first-line imaging modality required.
In very early stages or in cases of mild disease, chest radiographs can be normal, with findings being more extensive after ten to twelve days of the symptoms onset.
Overall, the imaging findings on a chest radiograph are non-specific, however common findings have been reported, such as airspace opacities (either described as consolidations or ground-glass opacities), and in the majority of cases these are bilateral, peripheral and most commonly found in the lower zones.
Pneumothorax associated with COVID-19 is only seen in about 1% of cases, and when present, raises suspicion for superadded bacterial infection and other diagnosis.
In our patient's chest radiograph, there was a large right-sided pneumothorax with associated lung collapse and consolidation.
On the left, lungs were clear.
Besides a recent positive swab for COVID-19, on admission the patient was in type 1 respiratory failure and bloods showed high inflammatory markers.
There was no underlying lung disease, smoking history and structural abnormality in the body that would predispose our patient to pneumothorax formation.
The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and right chest drainage, with improvement in radiograph, clinical and laboratory findings and was discharged home with a follow-up in the Respiratory Clinic.
