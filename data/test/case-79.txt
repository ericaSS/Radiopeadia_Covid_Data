COVID-19 pneumonia - AGE : 45 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Fever, dry cough and dyspnea for few days.
X-ray : Multiple peripheral opacifications, throughout both lungs.
CT : Peripheral subpleural ground glass densities, including the lower and upper lobes.
Consolidation, small nodular density and interlobular/lobular septal thickening are observed in some areas.
Slight thickening of the bronchial walls.
Several mediastinal lymphadenopathies, the largest 1 cm.
Case Discussion : The patient was PCR confirmed COVID-19.
Chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in the literature are generally in the form of peripheral subpleural ground glass densities, typically with a basal predominance.
Although there are regions of infection throughout the lungs in this case, they are still classic/typical for COVID-19.
