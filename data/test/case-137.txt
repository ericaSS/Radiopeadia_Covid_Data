COVID-19 pneumonia AGE : 40 years, GENDER : Male
Presentation : Fever, cough and breathlessness since 3 days.
No co-morbidities.
CT : CT chest plain images show multifocal areas of ground glass opacities, distributed peripherally in both lungs, predominantly in both lower lobes.
There were focal areas of interlobular septal thickening in the background of ground glass changes in lingular segment, representing crazy paving.
Large consolidation is noted in left lower lobe.
No cavitations.
No pleural effusion.
No significant lymphadenopathy.
These features are highly suspicious for corona virus infection, which were proved by positive PCR test.
Case Discussion : CT chest findings vary depending on the stage at which the suspected COVID-19 patient is screened.
Peripherally distributed scattered ground glass opacities are the most common findings, with crazy paving pattern and consolidations developing later in the disease.
CO-RADS staging system has been developed to guide proper clinico-radiological correlation.
